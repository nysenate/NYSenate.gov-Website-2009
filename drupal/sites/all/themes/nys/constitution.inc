Almighty God for our Freedom, in order to secure its blessings, DO
ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION.</span>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>ARTICLE I</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Bill Of Rights</P>

<P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>  [Rights, privileges and franchise secured; power of legislature to
  dispense with primary elections in certain cases]</STRONG></P>
<P>Section 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;No member of this state shall be disfranchised, or deprived
of any of the rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof, unless
by the law of the land, or the judgment of his or her peers, except that
the legislature may provide that there shall be no primary election held
to nominate candidates for public office or to elect persons to party
positions for any political party or parties in any unit of representation
of the state from which such candidates or persons are nominated or
elected whenever there is no contest or contests for such nominations
or election as may be prescribed by general law. (Amended by vote of
the people November 3, 1959; November 6, 2001.)<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P>

<P><STRONG>[Trial by jury; how waived]</STRONG></P>

<P>§2.	Trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed
by constitutional provision shall remain inviolate forever; but a jury trial
may be waived by the parties in all civil cases in the manner to be
prescribed by law. The legislature may provide, however, by law, that
a verdict may be rendered by not less than five-sixths of the jury in any
civil case. A jury trial may be waived by the defendant in all criminal
cases, except those in which the crime charged may be punishable by
death, by a written instrument signed by the defendant in person in open
court before and with the approval of a judge or justice of a court
having jurisdiction to try the offense. The legislature may enact laws,
not inconsistent herewith, governing the form, content, manner and time
of presentation of the instrument effectuating such waiver. (Amended
by Constitutional Convention of 1938 and approved by vote of the
people November 8, 1938.)  </P>

<P><STRONG>[Freedom of worship; religious liberty]</STRONG></P>

<P>§3.	The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and
worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed
in this state to all humankind; and no person shall be rendered incompetent to be a witness on account of his or her opinions on matters of
religious belief; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not
be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices
inconsistent with the peace or safety of this state. (Amended by vote of
the people November 6, 2001.)</P>

<P><STRONG>[Habeas corpus]</STRONG></P>

<P>§4.	The privilege of a writ or order of habeas corpus shall not be
suspended, unless, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety
requires it. (Amended by Constitutional Convention of 1938 and
approved by vote of the people November 8, 1938.)  </P>

<P><STRONG>[Bail; fines; punishments; detention of witnesses]</STRONG></P>

<P>§5.	Excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed,
nor shall cruel and unusual punishments be inflicted, nor shall witnesses
be unreasonably detained. </P>


<P><STRONG>[Grand jury; protection of certain enumerated rights; duty of public
officers to sign waiver of immunity and give testimony;  penalty for

<P>§6.	No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise
infamous crime (except in cases of impeachment, and in cases of militia
when in actual service, and the land, air and naval forces in time of war,
or which this state may keep with the consent of congress in time of
peace, and in cases of petit larceny under the regulation of the legislature), unless on indictment of a grand jury, except that a person held for
the action of a grand jury upon a charge for such an offense, other than
one punishable by death or life imprisonment, with the consent of the
district attorney, may waive indictment by a grand jury and consent to
be prosecuted on an information filed by the district attorney; such
waiver shall be evidenced by written instrument signed by the defendant
in open court in the presence of his or her counsel. In any trial in any
court whatever the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend
in person and with counsel as in civil actions and shall be informed of
the nature and cause of the accusation and be confronted with the
witnesses against him or her. No person shall be subject to be twice put
in jeopardy for the same offense; nor shall he or she be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself or herself, providing,
that any public officer who, upon being called before a grand jury to
testify concerning the conduct of his or her present office or of any
public office held by him or her within five years prior to such grand
jury call to testify, or the performance of his or her official duties in any
such present or prior offices, refuses to sign a waiver of immunity
against subsequent criminal prosecution, or to answer any relevant
question concerning such matters before such grand jury, shall by virtue
of such refusal, be disqualified from holding any other public office or
public employment for a period of five years from the date of such
refusal to sign a waiver of immunity against subsequent prosecution, or
to answer any relevant question concerning such matters before such
grand jury, and shall be removed from his or her present office by the
appropriate authority or shall forfeit his or her present office at the suit
of the attorney-general.</P>

<P>	The power of grand juries to inquire into the wilful misconduct in
office of public officers, and to find indictments or to direct the filing
of informations in connection with such inquiries, shall never be
suspended or impaired by law. No person shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due process of law. (Amended by Constitutional Convention of 1938 and approved by vote of the people November 8, 1938; further amended by vote of the people November 8, 1949;

law; but in every case the necessity of the road and the amount of all
damage to be sustained by the opening thereof shall be first determined
by a jury of freeholders, and such amount, together with the expenses
of the proceedings, shall be paid by the person to be benefitted. </P>

<P>	(d)	The use of property for the drainage of swamp or agricultural
lands is declared to be a public use, and general laws may be passed
permitting the owners or occupants of swamp or agricultural lands to
construct and maintain for the drainage thereof, necessary drains,
ditches and dykes upon the lands of others, under proper restrictions, on
making just compensation, and such compensation together with the
cost of such drainage may be assessed, wholly or partly, against any
property benefitted thereby;  but no special laws shall be enacted for
such purposes. (Amended by Constitutional Convention of 1938 and
approved by vote of the people November 8, 1938. Subdivision (e) repealed by vote of the people November 5, 1963. Subdivision (b)
repealed by vote of the people November 3, 1964.) </P>

town or village within the state may by an approving vote of the
majority of the qualified electors in such municipality voting on a
proposition therefor submitted at a general or special election authorize,
subject to state legislative supervision and control, the conduct of one
or both of the following categories of games of chance commonly
known as: (a) bingo or lotto, in which prizes are awarded on the basis
of designated numbers or symbols on a card conforming to numbers or
symbols selected at random; (b) games in which prizes are awarded on
the basis of a winning number or numbers, color or colors, or symbol
or symbols determined by chance from among those previously selected
or played, whether determined as the result of the spinning of a wheel,
a drawing or otherwise by chance. If authorized, such games shall be
subject to the following restrictions, among others which may be
prescribed by the legislature: (1) only bona fide religious, charitable or
non-profit organizations of veterans, volunteer firefighter and similar
non-profit organizations shall be permitted to conduct such games; (2)
the entire net proceeds of any game shall be exclusively devoted to the
lawful purposes of such organizations; (3) no person except a bona fide
member of any such organization shall participate in the management
or operation of such game; and (4) no person shall receive any remuneration for participating in the management or operation of any
such game. Unless otherwise provided by law, no single prize shall
exceed two hundred fifty dollars, nor shall any series of prizes on one
occasion aggregate more than one thousand dollars. The legislature shall
pass appropriate laws to effectuate the purposes of this subdivision,
ensure that such games are rigidly regulated to prevent commercialized
gambling, prevent participation by criminal and other undesirable
elements and the diversion of funds from the purposes authorized
hereunder and establish a method by which a municipality which has
authorized such games may rescind or revoke such authorization.
Unless permitted by the legislature, no municipality shall have the
power to pass local laws or ordinances relating to such games. Nothing
in this section shall prevent the legislature from passing laws more
restrictive than any of the provisions of this section. (Amendment

<P>§3.	The senate districts described in section three of article three of this
constitution as adopted by the people on November sixth, eighteen
hundred ninety-four are hereby continued for all of the purposes of
future reapportionments of senate districts pursuant to section four of
this article. (Formerly §3. Repealed and replaced by new §3 amended
by vote of the people November 6, 1962.) </P>

<P><STRONG>[Readjustments and reapportionments; when federal census to
control]</STRONG></P>

<P>§4.	Except as herein otherwise provided, the federal census taken in
the year nineteen hundred thirty and each federal census taken decennially thereafter shall be controlling as to the number of inhabitants in the
state or any part thereof for the purposes of the apportionment of
members of assembly and readjustment or alteration of senate and
assembly districts next occurring, in so far as such census and the
tabulation thereof purport to give the information necessary therefor.
The legislature, by law, shall provide for the making and tabulation by
state authorities of an enumeration of the inhabitants of the entire state
to be used for such purposes, instead of a federal census, if the taking
of a federal census in any tenth year from the year nineteen hundred
thirty be omitted or if the federal census fails to show the number of
aliens or Indians not taxed. If a federal census, though giving the
requisite information as to the state at large, fails to give the information
as to any civil or territorial divisions which is required to be known for
such purposes, the legislature, by law, shall provide for such an
enumeration of the inhabitants of such parts of the state only as may be
necessary, which shall supersede in part the federal census and be used
in connection therewith for such purposes. The legislature, by law, may
provide in its discretion for an enumeration by state authorities of the
inhabitants of the state, to be used for such purposes, in place of a
federal census, when the return of a decennial federal census is delayed
so that it is not available at the beginning of the regular session of the
legislature in the second year after the year nineteen hundred thirty or
after any tenth year therefrom, or if an apportionment of members of
assembly and readjustment or alteration of senate districts is not made
at or before such a session. At the regular session in the year nineteen
hundred thirty-two, and at the first regular session after the year
nineteen hundred forty and after each tenth year therefrom the senate
districts shall be readjusted or altered, but if, in any decade, counting
from and including that which begins with the year nineteen hundred
thirty-one, such a readjustment or alteration is not made at the time
above prescribed, it shall be made at a subsequent session occurring not
later than the sixth year of such decade, meaning not later than nineteen
hundred thirty-six, nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred
fifty-six, and so on; provided, however, that if such districts shall have
been readjusted or altered by law in either of the years nineteen hundred
thirty or nineteen hundred thirty-one, they shall remain unaltered until
the first regular session after the year nineteen hundred forty. Such
districts shall be so readjusted or altered that each senate district shall
contain as nearly as may be an equal number of inhabitants, excluding
aliens, and be in as compact form as practicable, and shall remain
unaltered until the first year of the next decade as above defined, and
shall at all times consist of contiguous territory, and no county shall be
divided in the formation of a senate district except to make two or more
senate districts wholly in such county. No town, except a town having
more than a full ratio of apportionment, and no block in a city inclosed
by streets or public ways, shall be divided in the formation of senate
districts; nor shall any district contain a greater excess in population
over an adjoining district in the same county, than the population of a
town or block therein adjoining such district. Counties, towns or blocks
which, from their location, may be included in either of two districts,
shall be so placed as to make said districts most nearly equal in number
of inhabitants, excluding aliens. </P>

<P>	No county shall have four or more senators unless it shall have a full
ratio for each senator. No county shall have more than one-third of all
the senators; and no two counties or the territory thereof as now
organized, which are adjoining counties, or which are separated only by
public waters, shall have more than one-half of all the senators. </P>

<P>	The ratio for apportioning senators shall always be obtained by
dividing the number of inhabitants, excluding aliens, by fifty, and the
senate shall always be composed of fifty members, except that if any
county having three or more senators at the time of any apportionment
shall be entitled on such ratio to an additional senator or senators, such
additional senator or senators shall be given to such county in addition
to the fifty senators, and the whole number of senators shall be
increased to that extent.</P>

<P>	The senate districts, including the present ones, as existing immediately before the enactment of a law readjusting or altering the senate
districts, shall continue to be the senate districts of the state until the
expirations of the terms of the senators then in office, except for the
purpose of an election of senators for full terms beginning at such
expirations, and for the formation of assembly districts. (Amended by
vote of the people November 6, 1945.)</P>

<P><STRONG>[Apportionment of assemblymen; creation of assembly districts]</STRONG></P>

<P>§5.	The members of the assembly shall be chosen by single districts
and shall be apportioned by the legislature at each regular session at
which the senate districts are readjusted or altered, and by the same law,
among the several counties of the state, as nearly as may be according
to the number of their respective inhabitants, excluding aliens. Every
county heretofore established and separately organized, except the
county of Hamilton, shall always be entitled to one member of assembly, and no county shall hereafter be erected unless its population shall
entitle it to a member. The county of Hamilton shall elect with the
county of Fulton, until the population of the county of Hamilton shall,
according to the ratio, entitle it to a member. But the legislature may
abolish the said county of Hamilton and annex the territory thereof to
some other county or counties. </P>

<P>	The quotient obtained by dividing the whole number of inhabitants
of the state, excluding aliens, by the number of members of assembly,
shall be the ratio for apportionment, which shall be made as follows:
One member of assembly shall be apportioned to every county,
including Fulton and Hamilton as one county, containing less than the
ratio and one-half over. Two members shall be apportioned to every
other county. The remaining members of assembly shall be apportioned
to the counties having more than two ratios according to the number of
inhabitants, excluding aliens. Members apportioned on remainders shall
be apportioned to the counties having the highest remainders in the
order thereof respectively. No county shall have more members of
assembly than a county having a greater number of inhabitants,
excluding aliens. </P>

<P>	<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>The assembly districts, including the present ones, as existing
immediately before the enactment of a law making an apportionment of
members of assembly among the counties, shall continue to be the
assembly districts of the state until the expiration of the terms of
members then in office, except for the purpose of an election of members of assembly for full terms beginning at such expirations. </P>

<P>	In any county entitled to more than one member, the board of
supervisors, and in any city embracing an entire county and having no
board of supervisors, the common council, or if there be none, the body
exercising the powers of a common council, shall assemble at such
times as the legislature making an apportionment shall prescribe, and
divide such counties into assembly districts as nearly equal in number
of inhabitants, excluding aliens, as may be, of convenient and contiguous territory in as compact form as practicable, each of which shall be
wholly within a senate district formed under the same apportionment,
equal to the number of members of assembly to which such county shall
be entitled, and shall cause to be filed in the office of the secretary of
state and of the clerk of such county, a description of such districts,
specifying the number of each district and of the inhabitants thereof,
excluding aliens, according to the census or enumeration used as the
population basis for the formation of such districts; and such apportionment and districts shall remain unaltered until after the next reapportionment of members of assembly, except that the board of supervisors
of any county containing a town having more than a ratio of apportionment and one-half over may alter the assembly districts in a senate
district containing such town at any time on or before March first,
nineteen hundred forty-six. In counties having more than one senate
district, the same number of assembly districts shall be put in each
senate district, unless the assembly districts cannot be evenly divided
among the senate districts of any county, in which case one more
assembly district shall be put in the senate district in such county having
the largest, or one less assembly district shall be put in the senate
district in such county having the smallest number of inhabitants,
excluding aliens, as the case may require. No town, except a town
having more than a ratio of apportionment and one-half over, and no
block in a city inclosed by streets or public ways, shall be divided in the
formation of assembly districts, nor shall any districts contain a greater
excess in population over an adjoining district in the same senate
district, than the population of a town or block therein adjoining such
assembly district. Towns or blocks which, from their location may be
included in either of two districts, shall be so placed as to make said
districts most nearly equal in number of inhabitants, excluding aliens.
Nothing in this section shall prevent the division, at any time, of
counties and towns and the erection of new towns by the legislature. </P>

<P>	An apportionment by the legislature, or other body, shall be subject
to review by the supreme court, at the suit of any citizen, under such
reasonable regulations as the legislature may prescribe; and any court
before which a cause may be pending involving an apportionment, shall
give precedence thereto over all other causes and proceedings, and if
said court be not in session it shall convene promptly for the disposition
of the same. (Amended by vote of the people November 6, 1945.) </P>

<P><STRONG>[Definition of inhabitants]</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>[Compensation, allowances and traveling expenses of members]</STRONG></P>

<P>§6.	Each member of the legislature shall receive for his or her services
a like annual salary, to be fixed by law. He or she shall also be reimbursed for his or her actual traveling expenses in going to and returning
from the place in which the legislature meets, not more than once each
week while the legislature is in session. Senators, when the senate alone
is convened in extraordinary session, or when serving as members of the
court for the trial of impeachments, and such members of the assembly,
not exceeding nine in number, as shall be appointed managers of an
impeachment, shall receive an additional per diem allowance, to be
fixed by law. Any member, while serving as an officer of his or her
house or in any other special capacity therein or directly connected
therewith not hereinbefore in this section specified, may also be paid
and receive, in addition, any allowance which may be fixed by law for
the particular and additional services appertaining to or entailed by such
office or special capacity. Neither the salary of any member nor any
other allowance so fixed may be increased or diminished during, and
with respect to, the term for which he or she shall have been elected, nor
shall he or she be paid or receive any other extra compensation. The
provisions of this section and laws enacted in compliance therewith
shall govern and be exclusively controlling, according to their terms.
Members shall continue to receive such salary and additional allowance
as heretofore fixed and provided in this section, until changed by law
pursuant to this section. (Amended by Constitutional Convention of

hereinafter provided, and may upon the request of the mayor and the
local legislative body of the city of New York, merge the two courts into
one city-wide court of both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The unified

<P><STRONG>[Court of appeals; organization; designations; vacancies, how filled;
commission on judicial nomination]</STRONG></P>

<P>§2.	a.	The court of appeals is continued. It shall consist of the chief
judge and the six elected associate judges now in office, who shall hold
their offices until the expiration of their respective terms, and their
successors, and such justices of the supreme court as may be designated
for service in said court as hereinafter provided. The official terms of
the chief judge and the six associate judges shall be fourteen years. </P>

<P>	Five members of the court shall constitute a quorum, and the
concurrence of four shall be necessary to a decision; but no more than
seven judges shall sit in any case. In case of the temporary absence or
inability to act of any judge of the court of appeals, the court may
designate any justice of the supreme court to serve as associate judge of
the court during such absence or inability to act. The court shall have
power to appoint and to remove its clerk. The powers and jurisdiction
of the court shall not be suspended for want of appointment when the
number of judges is sufficient to constitute a quorum. </P>

<P>	b.	Whenever and as often as the court of appeals shall certify to the
governor that the court is unable, by reason of the accumulation of
causes pending therein, to hear and dispose of the same with reasonable
speed, the governor shall designate such number of justices of the
supreme court as may be so certified to be necessary, but not more than
four, to serve as associate judges of the court of appeals. The justices so
designated shall be relieved, while so serving, from their duties as
justices of the supreme court, and shall serve as associate judges of the
court of appeals until the court shall certify that the need for the services
of any such justices no longer exists, whereupon they shall return to the
supreme court. The governor may fill vacancies among such designated
judges. No such justices shall serve as associate judge of the court of
appeals except while holding the office of justice of the supreme court.
The designation of a justice of the supreme court as an associate judge
of the court of appeals shall not be deemed to affect his or her existing
office any longer than until the expiration of his or her designation as
such associate judge, nor to create a vacancy. </P>

<P>	c.	There shall be a commission on judicial nomination to evaluate
the qualifications of candidates for appointment to the court of appeals
and to prepare a written report and recommend to the governor those
persons who by their character, temperament, professional aptitude and
experience are well qualified to hold such judicial office. The legislature
shall provide by law for the organization and procedure of the judicial
nominating commission. </P>

<P>	d.	(l)&nbsp;The commission on judicial nomination shall consist of twelve
members of whom four shall be appointed by the governor, four by the
chief judge of the court of appeals, and one each by the speaker of the
assembly, the temporary president of the senate, the minority leader of
the senate, and the minority leader of the assembly. Of the four
members appointed by the governor, no more than two shall be enrolled
in the same political party, two shall be members of the bar of the state,
and two shall not be members of the bar of the state. Of the four
members appointed by the chief judge of the court of appeals, no more
than two shall be enrolled in the same political party, two shall be
members of the bar of the state, and two shall not be members of the bar
of the state. No member of the commission shall hold or have held any
judicial office or hold any elected public office for which he or she
receives compensation during his or her period of service, except that
the governor and the chief judge may each appoint no more than one
former judge or justice of the unified court system to such commission.
No member of the commission shall hold any office in any political
party. No member of the judicial nominating commission shall be
eligible for appointment to judicial office in any court of the state
during the member's period of service or within one year thereafter. </P>

<P>	(2)	The members first appointed by the governor shall have respectively one, two, three and four year terms as the governor shall
designate. The members first appointed by the chief judge of the court
of appeals shall have respectively one, two, three and four year terms as
the chief judge shall designate. The member first appointed by the
temporary president of the senate shall have a one-year term. The
member first appointed by the minority leader of the senate shall have
a two-year term. The member first appointed by the speaker of the
assembly shall have a four-year term. The member first appointed by the
minority leader of the assembly shall have a three-year term. Each
subsequent appointment shall be for a term of four years. </P>

<P>	(3)	The commission shall designate one of their number to serve as
chairperson.</P>

<P>	(4)	The commission shall consider the qualifications of candidates for
appointment to the offices of judge and chief judge of the court of
appeals and, whenever a vacancy in those offices occurs, shall prepare
a written report and recommend to the governor persons who are well
qualified for those judicial offices. </P>

<P>	e.	The governor shall appoint, with the advice and consent of the
senate, from among those recommended by the judicial nominating
commission, a person to fill the office of chief judge or associate judge,
as the case may be, whenever a vacancy occurs in the court of appeals;
provided, however, that no person may be appointed a judge of the
court of appeals unless such person is a resident of the state and has
been admitted to the practice of law in this state for at least ten years.
The governor shall transmit to the senate the written report of the
commission on judicial nomination relating to the nominee. </P>

<P>	f.	When a vacancy occurs in the office of chief judge or associate
judge of the court of appeals and the senate is not in session to give its
advice and consent to an appointment to fill the vacancy, the governor
shall fill the vacancy by interim appointment upon the recommendation
of a commission on judicial nomination as provided in this section. An
interim appointment shall continue until the senate shall pass upon the
governor's selection. If the senate confirms an appointment, the judge
shall serve a term as provided in subdivision a of this section commencing from the date of his or her interim appointment. If the senate rejects
an appointment, a vacancy in the office shall occur sixty days after such
rejection. If an interim appointment to the court of appeals be made
from among the justices of the supreme court or the appellate divisions
thereof, that appointment shall not affect the justice's existing office, nor
create a vacancy in the supreme court, or the appellate division thereof,
unless such appointment is confirmed by the senate and the appointee
shall assume such office. If an interim appointment of chief judge of the
court of appeals be made from among the associate judges, an interim
appointment of associate judge shall be made in like manner; in such
case, the appointment as chief judge shall not affect the existing office
of associate judge, unless such appointment as chief judge is confirmed
by the senate and the appointee shall assume such office. </P>

<P>	g.	The provisions of subdivisions c, d, e and f of this section shall
not apply to temporary designations or assignments of judges or
justices. (Subdivision a amended, subdivision c repealed and new
subdivisions c through g added by vote of the people November 8,
1977; further amended by vote of the people November 6, 2001.) </P>

<P><STRONG>[Court of appeals; jurisdiction]</STRONG></P>

<P>§3.	a.	The jurisdiction of the court of appeals shall be limited to the
review of questions of law except where the judgment is of death, or
where the appellate division, on reversing or modifying a final or
interlocutory judgment in an action or a final or interlocutory order in
a special proceeding, finds new facts and a final judgment or a final
order pursuant thereto is entered; but the right to appeal shall not
depend upon the amount involved. </P>

<P>	b.	Appeals to the court of appeals may be taken in the classes of
cases hereafter enumerated in this section; </P>

<P>	In criminal cases, directly from a court of original jurisdiction where
the judgment is of death, and in other criminal cases from an appellate
division or otherwise as the legislature may from time to time provide. </P>

<P>	In civil cases and proceedings as follows: </P>

<P>	(1)	As of right, from a judgment or order entered upon the decision
of an appellate division of the supreme court which finally determines
an action or special proceeding wherein is directly involved the
construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States, or
where one or more of the justices of the appellate division dissents from
the decision of the court, or where the judgment or order is one of
reversal or modification. </P>

<P>	(2)	As of right, from a judgment or order of a court of record of
original jurisdiction which finally determines an action or special
proceeding where the only question involved on the appeal is the
validity of a statutory provision of the state or of the United States under
the constitution of the state or of the United States; and on any such
appeal only the constitutional question shall be considered and
determined by the court. </P>

<P>	(3)	As of right, from an order of the appellate division granting a new
trial in an action or a new hearing in a special proceeding where the
appellant stipulates that, upon affirmance, judgment absolute or final
order shall be rendered against him or her.</P>

<P>	(4)	From a determination of the appellate division of the supreme
court in any department, other than a judgment or order which finally
determines an action or special proceeding, where the appellate division
allows the same and certifies that one or more questions of law have
arisen which, in its opinion, ought to be reviewed by the court of
appeals, but in such case the appeal shall bring up for review only the
question or questions so certified; and the court of appeals shall certify
to the appellate division its determination upon such question or
questions. </P>

<P>	(5)	From an order of the appellate division of the supreme court in
any department, in a proceeding instituted by or against one or more
public officers or a board, commission or other body of public officers
or a court or tribunal, other than an order which finally determines such
proceeding, where the court of appeals shall allow the same upon the
ground that, in its opinion, a question of law is involved which ought to
be reviewed by it, and without regard to the availability of appeal by
stipulation for final order absolute. </P>

<P>	(6)	From a judgment or order entered upon the decision of an
appellate division of the supreme court which finally determines an
action or special proceeding but which is not appealable under
paragraph (1) of this subdivision where the appellate division or the
court of appeals shall certify that in its opinion a question of law is
involved which ought to be reviewed by the court of appeals. Such an
appeal may be allowed upon application (a) to the appellate division,
and in case of refusal, to the court of appeals, or (b) directly to the court
of appeals. Such an appeal shall be allowed when required in the
interest of substantial justice. </P>

<P>	(7)	No appeal shall be taken to the court of appeals from a judgment
or order entered upon the decision of an appellate division of the
supreme court in any civil case or proceeding where the appeal to the
appellate division was from a judgment or order entered in an appeal
from another court, including an appellate or special term of the
supreme court, unless the construction of the constitution of the state or
of the United States is directly involved therein, or unless the appellate
division of the supreme court shall certify that in its opinion a question
of law is involved which ought to be reviewed by the court of appeals.</P>

<P>	(8)	The legislature may abolish an appeal to the court of appeals as
of right in any or all of the cases or classes of cases specified in
paragraph (1) of this subdivision wherein no question involving the
construction of the constitution of the state or of the United States is
directly involved, provided, however, that appeals in any such case or
class of cases shall thereupon be governed by paragraph (6) of this
subdivision. </P>

<P>	(9)	The court of appeals shall adopt and from time to time may
amend a rule to permit the court to answer questions of New York law
certified to it by the Supreme Court of the United States, a court of
appeals of the United States or an appellate court of last resort of
another state, which may be determinative of the cause then pending in
the certifying court and which in the opinion of the certifying court are
not controlled by precedent in the decisions of the courts of New York.

district of the state. The second department shall consist of the counties
within the second, ninth, tenth and eleventh judicial districts of the
state. The third department shall consist of the counties within the third,
fourth and sixth judicial districts of the state. The fourth department
shall consist of the counties within the fifth, seventh and eighth judicial

unexpired portions of their respective terms of office, if less than five
years. </P>

<P>	d.	The justices heretofore designated shall continue to sit in the
appellate divisions until the terms of their respective designations shall

governor may also, on request of any appellate division, make temporary designations in case of the absence or inability to act of any justice
in such appellate division, for service only during such absence or
inability to act.</P>

<P>	e.	In case any appellate division shall certify to the governor that
one or more additional justices are needed for the speedy disposition of
the business before it, the governor may designate an additional justice
or additional justices; but when the need for such additional justice or
justices shall no longer exist, the appellate division shall so certify to the
governor, and thereupon service under such designation or designations
shall cease. </P>

<P>	f.	A majority of the justices designated to sit in any appellate
division shall at all times be residents of the department. </P>

<P>	g.	Whenever the appellate division in any department shall be

pending appeals from such department to any other department for
hearing and determination. </P>

<P>	h.	A justice of the appellate division of the supreme court in any
department may be temporarily designated by the presiding justice of
his or her department to the appellate division in another judicial department upon agreement by the presiding justices of the appellate division
of the departments concerned. </P>

of justices in any appellate division prevents there being a quorum of
justices qualified to hear an appeal, the justices qualified to hear the
appeal may transfer it to the appellate division in another department for
hearing and determination. In the event that the justices in any appellate
division qualified to hear an appeal are equally divided, said justices
may transfer the appeal to the appellate division in another department
for hearing and determination. Each appellate division shall have power
to appoint and remove its clerk.</P>

<P>	j.	No justice of the appellate division shall, within the department
to which he or she may be designated to perform the duties of an
appellate justice, exercise any of the powers of a justice of the supreme
court, other than those of a justice out of court, and those pertaining to
the appellate division, except that the justice may decide causes or
proceedings theretofore submitted, or hear and decide motions
submitted by consent of counsel, but any such justice, when not actually
engaged in performing the duties of such appellate justice in the
department to which he or she is designated, may hold any term of the
supreme court and exercise any of the powers of a justice of the
supreme court in any judicial district in any other department of the
state. </P>

<P>	k.	The appellate divisions of the supreme court shall have all the
jurisdiction possessed by them on the effective date of this article and
such additional jurisdiction as may be prescribed by law, provided,
however, that the right to appeal to the appellate divisions from a
judgment or order which does not finally determine an action or special
proceeding may be limited or conditioned by law. (Subdivision e

judgment or order may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may
modify the judgment or order appealed from, and each interlocutory
judgment or intermediate or other order which it is authorized to review,
and as to any or all of the parties. It shall thereupon render judgment of
affirmance, judgment of reversal and final judgment upon the right of
any or all of the parties, or judgment of modification thereon according
to law, except where it may be necessary or proper to grant a new trial
or hearing, when it may grant a new trial or hearing.</P>

and 13 of this article, all debts contracted by the state and each portion
of any such debt from time to time so contracted shall be subject to the
following rules:  </P>

<P>	1.	The principal of each debt or any portion thereof shall either be
paid in equal annual installments or in installments that result in
substantially level or declining debt service payments such as shall be
authorized by law, or, in the alternative, contributions of principal in the
amount that would otherwise be required to be paid annually shall be
made to a sinking fund. </P>

<P>	2.	When some portions of the same debt are payable annually while
other portions require contributions to a sinking fund, the entire debt
shall be structured so that the combined amount of annual installments
of principal paid and/or annual contributions of principal made in each
year shall be equal to the amount that would be required to be paid if
the entire debt were payable in annual installments. </P>

<P>	3.	When interest on state obligations is not paid at least annually,
there shall also be contributed to a sinking fund at least annually, the
amount necessary to bring the balance thereof, including income earned
on contributions, to the accreted value of the obligations to be paid
therefrom on the date such contribution is made, less the sum of all
required future contributions of principal, in the case of sinking fund
obligations, or payments of principal, in the case of serial obligations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this subdivision
shall be deemed to require contributions for interest to sinking funds if
total debt service due on the debt or portion thereof in the year such
interest is due will be substantially the same as the total debt service due
on such debt or portion thereof in each other year or if the total amount
of debt service due in each subsequent year on such debt or portion
thereof shall be less than the total debt service due in each prior year.</P>

<P>	4.	The first annual installment on such debt shall be paid, or the first
annual contribution shall be made to a sinking fund, not more than one
year, and the last installment shall be paid, or contribution made not
more than forty years, after such debt or portion thereof shall have been
contracted, provided, however, that in contracting any such debt the
privilege of paying all or any part of such debt prior to the date on

as may be provided by law. </P>

the probable life of the work or purpose for which the debt is to be
contracted, or in the alternative, the weighted average period of
probable life of the works or purposes for which such indebtedness is
to be contracted. The probable lives of such works or purposes shall be
determined by general laws, which determination shall be conclusive.</P>

shall be applied only to the work or purpose specified in the act
authorizing such debt or liability, or for the payment of such debt or
liability, including any notes or obligations issued in anticipation of the
sale of bonds evidencing such debt or liability.</P>

<P>	7.	Any sinking funds created pursuant to this section shall be
maintained and managed by the state comptroller or an agent or trustee
designated by the state comptroller, and amounts in sinking funds
created pursuant to this section, and earnings thereon, shall be used

that amounts in excess of the required balance on any contribution date
and amounts remaining in such funds after all of the obligations secured
thereby have been retired shall be deposited in the general fund.</P>

<P>	10.	When state obligations are sold at a discount, the debt incurred
for purposes of determining the amount of debt issued or outstanding
pursuant to a voter approved bond referendum or other limitation on the

<P><STRONG>[Refund of state debts]</STRONG></P>

<P>§13.	The legislature may provide means and authority whereby any
state debt or debts, or any portion or combination thereof, may be
refunded in accordance with the following provisions:  </P>

<P>	1.	State debts may be refunded at any time after they are incurred
provided that the state will achieve a debt service savings on a present
value basis as a result of the refunding transaction, and further provided
that no maturity shall be called for redemption unless the privilege to
pay prior to the maturity date was reserved to the state. The legislature
may provide for the method of computation of present value for such
purpose. </P>

<P>	2.	In no event shall refunding obligations be issued in an amount
exceeding that necessary to provide sufficient funds to accomplish the
refunding of the obligations to be refunded including paying all costs
and expenses related to the refunding transaction and, in no event, shall
the proceeds of refunding obligations be applied to any purpose other
than accomplishing the refunding of the debt to be refunded and paying
costs and expenses related to the refunding. </P>

<P>	3.	Proceeds of refunding obligations shall be deposited in escrow
funds which shall be maintained and managed by the state comptroller
or by an agent or trustee designated by the state comptroller and no
legislative appropriation shall be required for disbursement of money,
or income earned thereon, from such escrow funds for the purposes
enumerated in this section. </P>

<P>	4.	Refunding obligations may be refunded pursuant to this section.</P>

<P>	5.	Refunding obligations shall either be paid in annual installments
or annual contributions shall be made to a sinking fund in amounts
sufficient to retire the refunding obligations at their maturity. No annual
installments or contributions of principal need be made with respect to
all or any portion of an issue of refunding obligations in years when
debt service on such refunding obligations or portion thereof is paid or
contributed entirely from an escrow fund created pursuant to subdivision 3 of this section or in years when no installments or contributions
would have been due on the obligations to be refunded. So long as any
of the refunding obligations remain outstanding, installments or
contributions shall be made in any years that installments or contributions would have been due on the obligations to be refunded. </P>

<P>	6.	 In no event shall the last annual installment or contribution on
any portion of refunding debt, including refunding obligations issued to
refund other refunding obligations, be made after the termination of the
period of probable life of the projects financed with the proceeds of the
relevant portion of the debt to be refunded, or any debt previously
refunded with the refunding obligations to be refunded, determined as
of the date of issuance of the original obligations pursuant to section 12
of this article to finance such projects, or forty years from such date, if
earlier; provided, however, that in lieu of the foregoing, an entire
refunding issue or portion thereof may be structured to mature over the
remaining weighted average useful life of all projects financed with the
obligations being refunded. </P>

<P>	7.	 Subject to the provisions of subdivision 5 of this section, each
annual installment or contribution of principal of refunding obligations
shall be equal to the amount that would be required by subdivision 1 of
section 12 of this article if such installments or contributions were
required to be made from the year that the next installment or contribution would have been due on the obligations to be refunded, if they had
not been refunded, until the final maturity of the refunding obligations
but excluding any year in which no installment or contribution would
have been due on the obligations to be refunded or, in the alternative,
the total payments of principal and interest on the refunding bonds shall
be less in each year to their final maturity than the total payments of
principal and interest on the bonds to be refunded in each such year. </P>

<P>	8.	 The provisions of subdivision 3 and subdivisions 7 through 9 of
section 12 of this article shall apply to sinking funds created pursuant
to this section for the payment at maturity of refunding obligations.

dollars, to provide moneys for the elimination, under state supervision,
of railroad crossings at grade within the state, and for incidental

<P>	The expense of any grade crossing elimination the construction work
for which was not commenced before January first, nineteen hundred
thirty-nine, including incidental improvements connected therewith as
authorized by this section, whether or not an order for such elimination
shall theretofore have been made, shall be paid by the state in the first
instance, but the state shall be entitled to recover from the railroad
company or companies, by way of reimbursement (1) the entire amount
of the railroad improvements not an essential part of elimination, and
(2) the amount of the net benefit to the company or companies from the
elimination exclusive of such railroad improvements, the amount of
such net benefit to be adjudicated after the completion of the work in
the manner to be prescribed by law, and in no event to exceed fifteen
per centum of the expense of the elimination, exclusive of all incidental
improvements. The reimbursement by the railroad companies shall be
payable at such times, in such manner and with interest at such rate as
the legislature may prescribe. </P>

<P>	The expense of any grade crossing elimination the construction work
for which was commenced before January first, nineteen hundred
thirty-nine, shall be borne by the state, railroad companies, and the
municipality or municipalities in the proportions formerly prescribed by
section 14 of article VII of the constitution in force on July first,
nineteen hundred thirty-eight, and the law or laws enacted pursuant to
its provisions, applicable to such elimination, and subject to the
provisions of such former section and law or laws, including advances
in aid of any railroad company or municipality, although such elimination shall not be completed until after January first, nineteen hundred
thirty-nine. </P>

<P>	A grade crossing elimination the construction work for which shall
be commenced after January first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine, shall
include incidental improvements rendered necessary or desirable
because of such elimination, and reasonably included in the engineering
plans therefor. Out of the balance of all moneys authorized to be
expended under section 14 of article VII of the constitution in force on
July first, nineteen hundred thirty-eight, and remaining unexpended and
unobligated on such date, fifty million dollars shall be deemed
segregated for grade crossing eliminations and incidental improvements
in the city of New York and shall be available only for such purposes
until such eliminations and improvements are completed and paid for.</P>

<P>	Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section the

<P>§15.	The sinking funds provided for the payment of interest and the
extinguishment of the principal of the debts of the state heretofore
contracted shall be continued; they shall be separately kept and safely
invested, and neither of them shall be appropriated or used in any
manner other than for such payment and extinguishment as hereinafter
provided. The comptroller shall each year appraise the securities held
for investment in each of such funds at their fair market value not
exceeding par. The comptroller shall then determine and certify to the
legislature the amount of each of such funds and the amounts which, if
thereafter annually contributed to each such fund, would, with the fund
and with the accumulations thereon and upon the contributions thereto,
computed at the rate of three per centum per annum, produce at the date
of maturity the amount of the debt to retire which such fund was
created, and the legislature shall thereupon appropriate as the contribution to each such fund for such year at least the amount thus certified. </P>

<P>	If the income of any such fund in any year is more than a sum which,
if annually added to such fund would, with the fund and its accumulations as aforesaid, retire the debt at maturity, the excess income may be
applied to the interest on the debt for which the fund was created.</P>

<P>	After any sinking fund shall equal in amount the debt for which it was
created no further contribution shall be made thereto except to make
good any losses ascertained at the annual appraisals above mentioned,

under section 9 of this article, as the same shall fall due, and for the
contribution to all of the sinking funds created by law, of the amounts
annually to be contributed under the provisions of section 12, 13 or 15

thereafter received, applicable to the general fund of the state, a sum
sufficient to pay such interest, installments of principal, or contributions
to such sinking fund, as the case may be, and shall so apply the moneys
thus set apart. The comptroller may be required to set aside and apply
such revenues as aforesaid, at the suit of any holder of such bonds. </P>

<P>	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the comptroller may covenant with the purchasers of any state obligations that
they shall have no further rights against the state for payment of such
obligations or any interest thereon after an amount or amounts determined in accordance with the provisions of such covenant is deposited
in a described fund or with a named or described agency or trustee. In
such case, this section shall have no further application with respect to
payment of such obligations or any interest thereon after the comptroller

to which such fund relates, and shall prescribe the method of determining the amount of revenue from any such tax or taxes which shall
constitute a norm of each fiscal year. Such part as shall be prescribed by
law of any revenue derived from such tax or taxes during a fiscal year
in excess of such norm shall be paid into such fund. No moneys shall at
any time be withdrawn from such fund unless the revenue derived from
such tax or taxes during a fiscal year shall fall below the norm for such
year; in which event such amount as may be prescribed by law, but in
no event an amount exceeding the difference between such revenue and
such norm, shall be paid from such fund into the general fund.</P>

be determined by such governing body computed from the date such
indebtedness was contracted. </P>

<P>	No indebtedness shall be contracted by any county, city, town, village
or school district unless such county, city, town, village or school
district shall have pledged its faith and credit for the payment of the
principal thereof and the interest thereon. Except for indebtedness
contracted in anticipation of the collection of taxes actually levied and
uncollected or to be levied for the year when such indebtedness is
contracted and indebtedness contracted to be paid in one of the two
fiscal years immediately succeeding the fiscal year in which such
indebtedness was contracted, all such indebtedness and each portion
thereof from time to time contracted, including any refunding thereof,
shall be paid in annual installments, the first of which, except in the case
of refunding of indebtedness heretofore contracted, shall be paid not
more than two years after such indebtedness or portion thereof shall
have been contracted, and no installment, except in the case of
refunding of indebtedness heretofore contracted, shall be more than fifty
per centum in excess of the smallest prior installment, unless the
governing body of the county, city, town, village or school district contracting such indebtedness provides for substantially level or declining
debt service payments as may be authorized by law. </P>

<P>	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, indebtedness contracted
by the city of New York and each portion of any such indebtedness
from time to time so contracted for the supply of water, including the
acquisition of land in connection with such purpose, may be financed
either by serial bonds with a maximum maturity of fifty years, in which
case such indebtedness shall be paid in annual installments as hereinbefore provided, or by sinking fund bonds with a maximum maturity of
fifty years, which shall be redeemed through annual contributions to
sinking funds established and maintained for the purpose of amortizing
the indebtedness for which such bonds are issued. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, indebtedness hereafter contracted by the city of
New York and each portion of any such indebtedness from time to time
so contracted for (a) the acquisition, construction or equipment of rapid
transit railroads, or (b) the construction of docks, including the
acquisition of land in connection with any of such purposes, may be
financed either by serial bonds with a maximum maturity of forty years,
in which case such indebtedness shall be paid in annual installments as
hereinbefore provided, or by sinking fund bonds with a maximum
maturity of forty years, which shall be redeemed through annual
contributions to sinking funds established and maintained for the
purpose of amortizing the indebtedness for which such bonds are
issued. </P>

<P>	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, but subject to such requirements as the legislature shall impose by general or special law,
indebtedness contracted by any county, city, town, village or school
district and each portion thereof from time to time contracted for any
object or purpose for which indebtedness may be contracted may also
be financed by sinking fund bonds with a maximum maturity of fifty
years, which shall be redeemed through annual contributions to sinking
funds established by such county, city, town, village or school district,
provided, however, that each such annual contribution shall be at least
equal to the amount required, if any, to enable the sinking fund to
redeem, on the date of the contribution, the same amount of such
indebtedness as would have been paid and then be payable if such
indebtedness had been financed entirely by the issuance of serial bonds,
except, if an issue of sinking fund bonds is combined for sale with an
issue of serial bonds, for the same object or purpose, then the amount
of each annual sinking fund contribution shall be at least equal to the
amount required, if any, to enable the sinking fund to redeem, on the
date of each such annual contribution, (i) the amount which would be
required to be paid annually if such indebtedness had been issued
entirely as serial bonds, less (ii) the amount of indebtedness, if any, to
be paid during such year on the portion of such indebtedness actually
issued as serial bonds. Sinking funds established on or after January
first, nineteen hundred eighty-six pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be maintained and managed by the state comptroller pursuant to
such requirements and procedures as the legislature shall prescribe,
including provisions for reimbursement by the issuer of bonds payable
from such sinking funds for the expenses related to such maintenance
and management.</P>

<P>	Provisions shall be made annually by appropriation by every county,
city, town, village and school district for the payment of interest on all
indebtedness and for the amounts required for (a) the amortization and
redemption of term bonds, sinking fund bonds and serial bonds, (b) the
redemption of certificates or other evidence of indebtedness (except
those issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes or other revenues,
or renewals thereof, and which are described in paragraph A of section
five of this article and those issued in anticipation of the receipt of the
proceeds of the sale of bonds theretofore authorized) contracted to be
paid in such year out of the tax levy or other revenues applicable to a
reduction thereof, and (c) the redemption of certificates or other
evidence of indebtedness issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes
or other revenues, or renewals thereof, which are not retired within five
years after their date of original issue. If at any time the respective
appropriating authorities shall fail to make such appropriations, a
sufficient sum shall be set apart from the first revenues thereafter
received and shall be applied to such purposes. The fiscal officer of any
county, city, town, village or school district may be required to set apart
and apply such revenues as aforesaid at the suit of any holder of
obligations issued for any such indebtedness.</P>

<P>	Notwithstanding the foregoing, all interest need not be paid annually
on an issue of indebtedness provided that either (a) substantially level
or declining debt service payments (including all payments of interest)
shall be made over the life of such issue of indebtedness, or (b) there
shall annually be contributed to a sinking fund created pursuant to this
section, the amount necessary to bring the balance thereof, including
income earned on contributions, to the accreted value of the obligations
to be paid therefrom on the date such contribution is made, less the sum
of all required future contributions of principal, in the case of sinking
fund obligations, or payments of principal, in the case of serial
obligations. When obligations are sold by a county, city, town, village
or school district at a discount, the debt incurred for the purposes of any
debt limitation contained in this constitution, shall be deemed to include
only the amount of money actually received by the county, city, town,
village or school district, irrespective of the face amount of the
obligations. (New. Adopted by Constitutional Convention of 1938 and

evidences of indebtedness issued in any fiscal year in anticipation of (a)
the collection of taxes on real estate for amounts theretofore actually
levied and uncollected or to be levied in such year and payable out of
such taxes, (b) moneys receivable from the state which have theretofore
been apportioned by the state or which are to be so apportioned within
one year after their issue and (c) the collection of any other taxes due
and payable or to become due and payable within one year or of other
revenues to be received within one year after their issue; excepting any
such certificates or other evidences of indebtedness or renewals thereof
which are not retired within five years after their date of original issue.</P>

to such county, city, town or village net revenue; provided, however,
that such net revenue shall be twenty-five per centum or more of the
amount required in such year for the payment of the interest on,
amortization of, or payment of, such indebtedness. Such exclusion shall
be granted only if the revenues of such public improvement or part
thereof, or service, are applied to and actually used for payment of all
costs of operation, maintenance and repairs, and payment of the
amounts required in such year for interest on and amortization of or
redemption of such indebtedness, or such revenues are deposited in a
special fund to be used solely for such payments. Any revenues
remaining after such payments are made may be used for any lawful
purpose of such county, city, town or village, respectively. </P>

<P>	Net revenue shall be determined by deducting from gross revenues of
the preceding year all costs of operation, maintenance and repairs for
such year, or the legislature may provide that net revenue shall be

be contracted also may be granted for the period from the date when
such indebtedness is first contracted or to be contracted for such public
improvement or part thereof, or service, through the first year of

exclusion shall be computed in the manner provided in this section on
the basis of estimated net revenue which shall be determined by
deducting from the gross revenues estimated to be received during the
first year of operation of such public improvement or part thereof, or
service, all estimated costs of operation, maintenance and repairs for
such year. The amount of any such proportionate exclusion shall not
exceed seventy-five per centum of the amount which would be excluded
if the computation were made on the basis of net revenue instead of
estimated net revenue. </P>

<P>	Except as otherwise provided herein, the legislature shall prescribe
the method by which and the terms and conditions under which the
proportionate amount of any such indebtedness to be so excluded shall
be determined and no proportionate amount of such indebtedness shall
be excluded except in accordance with such determination. The legislature may provide that the state comptroller shall make such determination or it may confer appropriate jurisdiction on the appellate division
of the supreme court in the judicial departments in which such counties,
cities, towns or villages are located for the purpose of determining the
proportionate amount of any such indebtedness to be so excluded.</P>

of the liabilities of such system or fund, accrued on the date of issuing
such bonds, both on account of pensioners on the pension roll on that
date and prospective pensions to dependents of such pensioners and on
account of prior service of active members of such system or fund on
that date. Such bonds or the proceeds thereof shall be deposited in such

in paragraphs A and D of section five of this article, or renewals thereof:</P>

<P>	(a)	 any county, for county purposes, one and one-half per centum;
provided, however, that the legislature may prescribe a method by

valuations of taxable real estate on the last completed assessment rolls

district, and applying thereto the ratio which such assessed valuation on
each of such rolls bears to the full valuation, as determined by the state
tax commission or by such other state officer or agency as the legislature shall by law direct. The legislature shall prescribe the manner by
which such ratio shall be determined by the state tax commission or by
such other state officer or agency. </P>

<P>	Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to restrict the
powers granted to the legislature by other provisions of this constitution

<P><STRONG>[Application and use of revenues: certain public improvements]</STRONG></P>

<P>§10-a.	 For the purpose of determining the amount of taxes which may
be raised on real estate pursuant to section ten of this article, the
revenues received in each fiscal year by any county, city or village from
a public improvement or part thereof, or service, owned or rendered by
such county, city or village for which bonds or capital notes are issued
after January first, nineteen hundred fifty, shall be applied first to the
payment of all costs of operation, maintenance and repairs thereof, and
then to the payment of the amounts required in such fiscal year to pay
the interest on and the amortization of, or payment of, indebtedness
contracted for such public improvement or part thereof, or service. The
provisions of this section shall not prohibit the use of excess revenues
for any lawful county, city or village purpose. The provisions of this
section shall not be applicable to a public improvement or part thereof
constructed to provide for the supply of water. (New section added by

<P><STRONG>[Taxes for certain capital expenditures to be excluded from tax
limitation]</STRONG></P>

<P>§11.&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)	Whenever the city of New York is required by law to pay for
all or any part of the cost of capital improvements by direct budgetary
appropriation in any fiscal year or by the issuance of certificates or other
evidence of indebtedness (except serial bonds of an issue having a
maximum maturity of more than two years) to be redeemed in one of the
two immediately succeeding fiscal years, taxes required for such
appropriation or for the redemption of such certificates or other
evidence of indebtedness may be excluded in whole or in part by such
city from the tax limitation prescribed by section ten of this article, in
which event the total amount so required for such appropriation and for
the redemption of such certificates or other evidence of indebtedness
shall be deemed to be indebtedness to the same extent and in the same
manner as if such amount had been financed through indebtedness
payable in equal annual installments over the period of the probable
usefulness of such capital improvement, as determined by law. The
fiscal officer of such city shall determine the amount to be deemed
indebtedness pursuant to this section, and the legislature, in its
discretion, may provide that such determination, if approved by the state
comptroller, shall be conclusive. Any amounts determined to be deemed
indebtedness of any county, city, other than the city of New York,
village or school district in accordance with the provisions of this
section as in force and effect prior to January first, nineteen hundred
fifty-two, shall not be deemed to be indebtedness on and after such date.</P>

<P>	(b)	  Whenever any county, city, other than the city of New York,
village or school district which is coterminous with, or partly within, or
wholly within, a city having less than one hundred twenty-five thousand
inhabitants according to the latest federal census provides by direct
budgetary appropriation for any fiscal year for the payment in such
fiscal year or in any future fiscal year or years of all or any part of the
cost of an object or purpose for which a period of probable usefulness
has been determined by law, the taxes required for such appropriation
shall be excluded from the tax limitation prescribed by section ten of
this article unless the legislature otherwise provides. (New. Adopted by
Constitutional Convention of 1938 and approved by vote of the people
November 8, 1938; amended by vote of the people November 8, 1949,

<P><STRONG>[Powers of local governments to be restricted; further limitations on
contracting local indebtedness authorized]</STRONG></P>

<P>§12.	It shall be the duty of the legislature, subject to the provisions of
this constitution, to restrict the power of taxation, assessment, borrowing money, contracting indebtedness, and loaning the credit of counties,
cities, towns and villages, so as to prevent abuses in taxation and
assessments and in contracting of indebtedness by them. Nothing in this
article shall be construed to prevent the legislature from further
restricting the powers herein specified of any county, city, town, village
or school district to contract indebtedness or to levy taxes on real estate.
The legislature shall not, however, restrict the power to levy taxes on
real estate for the payment of interest on or principal of indebtedness
theretofore contracted. (New. Adopted by Constitutional Convention of

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Local Governments</P>

<P><STRONG>Bill of rights for local governments.</STRONG></P>

<P>Section 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Effective local self-government and intergovernmental
cooperation are purposes of the people of the state. In furtherance
thereof, local governments shall have the following rights, powers,
privileges and immunities in addition to those granted by other
provisions of this constitution:  </P>

<P>	(a)	Every local government, except a county wholly included within
a city, shall have a legislative body elective by the people thereof. Every
local government shall have power to adopt local laws as provided by
this article. </P>

<P>	(b)	All officers of every local government whose election or
appointment is not provided for by this constitution shall be elected by
the people of the local government, or of some division thereof, or
appointed by such officers of the local government as may be provided
by law.  </P>

<P>	(c)	Local governments shall have power to agree, as authorized by
act of the legislature, with the federal government, a state or one or
more other governments within or without the state, to provide
cooperatively, jointly or by contract any facility, service, activity or
undertaking which each participating local government has the power
to provide separately. Each such local government shall have power to
apportion its share of the cost thereof upon such portion of its area as
may be authorized by act of the legislature.</P>

<P>	(d)	No local government or any part of the territory thereof shall be
annexed to another until the people, if any, of the territory proposed to be
annexed shall have consented thereto by majority vote on a referendum
and until the governing board of each local government, the area of which
is affected, shall have consented thereto upon the basis of a determination
that the annexation is in the over-all public interest. The consent of the
governing board of a county shall be required only where a boundary of
the county is affected. On or before July first, nineteen hundred sixty-four,
the legislature shall provide, where such consent of a governing board is
not granted, for adjudication and determination, on the law and the facts,
in a proceeding initiated in the supreme court, of the issue of whether the
annexation is in the over-all public interest.</P>

<P>	(e)	Local governments shall have power to take by eminent domain
private property within their boundaries for public use together with
excess land or property but no more than is sufficient to provide for
appropriate disposition or use of land or property which abuts on that
necessary for such public use, and to sell or lease that not devoted to
such use. The legislature may authorize and regulate the exercise of the
power of eminent domain and excess condemnation by a local government outside its boundaries. </P>

<P>	(f)	No local government shall be prohibited by the legislature (1)
from making a fair return on the value of the property used and useful
in its operation of a gas, electric or water public utility service, over and
above costs of operation and maintenance and necessary and proper
reserves, in addition to an amount equivalent to taxes which such
service, if privately owned, would pay to such local government, or (2)
from using such profits for payment of refunds to consumers or for any
other lawful purpose. </P>

<P>	(g)	A local government shall have power to apportion its cost of a
governmental service or function upon any portion of its area, as
authorized by act of the legislature. </P>

<P>	(h) (1)	Counties, other than those wholly included within a city, shall
be empowered by general law, or by special law enacted upon county
request pursuant to section two of this article, to adopt, amend or repeal
alternative forms of county government provided by the legislature or
to prepare, adopt, amend or repeal alternative forms of their own. Any
such form of government or any amendment thereof, by act of the
legislature or by local law, may transfer one or more functions or duties
of the county or of the cities, towns, villages, districts or other units of
government wholly contained in such county to each other or when
authorized by the legislature to the state, or may abolish one or more
offices, departments, agencies or units of government provided,
however, that no such form or amendment, except as provided in
paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall become effective unless
approved on a referendum by a majority of the votes cast thereon in the
area of the county outside of cities, and in the cities of the county, if
any, considered as one unit. Where an alternative form of county
government or any amendment thereof, by act of the legislature or by
local law, provides for the transfer of any function or duty to or from
any village or the abolition of any office, department, agency or unit of
government of a village wholly contained in such county, such form or
amendment shall not become effective unless it shall also be approved
on the referendum by a majority of the votes cast thereon in all the
villages so affected considered as one unit.</P>

<P>	(2)	After the adoption of an alternative form of county government
by a county, any amendment thereof by act of the legislature or by local
law which abolishes or creates an elective county office, changes the
voting or veto power of or the method of removing an elective county
officer during his or her term of office, abolishes, curtails or transfers to
another county officer or agency any power of an elective county officer
or changes the form or composition of the county legislative body shall
be subject to a permissive referendum as provided by the legislature.

adopt local laws which impair the powers of any other local government.</P>

<P>	(e)	The rights and powers of local governments specified in this
section insofar as applicable to any county within the city of New York
shall be vested in such city. (Amended by vote of the people November
7, 2001.)</P>

vicinity of the city of Glens Falls, thence northerly to the vicinity of the
villages of Lake George and Warrensburg, the hamlets of South Horicon

relocating, reconstructing and maintaining a total of not more than fifty
miles of existing state highways for the purpose of eliminating the
hazards of dangerous curves and grades, provided a total of no more
than four hundred acres of forest preserve land shall be used for such
purpose and that no single relocated portion of any highway shall
exceed one mile in length. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions,
the state may convey to the village of Saranac Lake ten acres of forest
preserve land adjacent to the boundaries of such village for public use
in providing for refuse disposal and in exchange therefore the village of
Saranac Lake shall convey to the state thirty acres of certain true forest
land owned by such village on Roaring Brook in the northern half of
Lot 113, Township 11, Richards Survey. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions, the state may convey to the town of Arietta twenty-eight
acres of forest preserve land within such town for public use in
providing for the extension of the runway and landing strip of the
Piseco airport and in exchange therefor the town of Arietta shall convey
to the state thirty acres of certain land owned by such town in the town
of Arietta. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and subject to
legislative approval of the tracts to be exchanged prior to the actual
transfer of title, the state, in order to consolidate its land holdings for
better management, may convey to International Paper Company
approximately eight thousand five hundred acres of forest preserve land
located in townships two and three of Totten and Crossfield's Purchase
and township nine of the Moose River Tract, Hamilton county, and in
exchange therefore International Paper Company shall convey to the
state for incorporation into the forest preserve approximately the same
number of acres of land located within such townships and such County
on condition that the legislature shall determine that the lands to be
received by the state are at least equal in value to the lands to be
conveyed by the state. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and
subject to legislative approval of the tracts to be exchanged prior to the
actual transfer of title and the conditions herein set forth, the state, in
order to facilitate the preservation of historic buildings listed on the
national register of historic places by rejoining an historic grouping of
buildings under unitary ownership and stewardship, may convey to
Sagamore Institute, Inc., a not-for-profit educational organization,
approximately ten acres of land and buildings thereon adjoining the real
property of the Sagamore Institute, Inc. and located on Sagamore Road,
near Racquette Lake Village, in the Town of Long Lake, county of
Hamilton, and in exchange therefor; Sagamore Institute, Inc. shall
convey to the state for incorporation into the forest preserve approximately two hundred acres of wild forest land located within the
Adirondack Park on condition that the legislature shall determine that
the lands to be received by the state are at least equal in value to the
lands and buildings to be conveyed by the state and that the natural and
historic character of the lands and buildings conveyed by the state will
be secured by appropriate covenants and restrictions and that the lands
and buildings conveyed by the state will reasonably be available for
public visits according to agreement between Sagamore Institute, Inc.
and the state. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions the state may
convey to the town of Arietta fifty acres of  forest preserve land within
such town for public use in providing for the extension of the runway
and landing strip of the Piseco airport and providing for the maintenance of a clear zone around such runway, and in exchange therefor, the

the state for incorporation into the forest preserve approximately one
hundred forty-four acres of land, together with an easement over land
owned by such town including the riverbed adjacent to the land to be
conveyed to the state that will restrict further development of such land,

received by the state is at least equal in value to the land to be conveyed
by the state. </P>
<P>Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and subject to legislative
  approval prior to actual transfer of title, because there is no viable 
  alternative to using forest preserve lands for the siting of drinking water 
  wells and necessary appurtenances and because such wells are
  necessary to meet drinking water quality standards, the state may
  convey to the town of Long Lake, Hamilton county, one acre of forest
  preserve land within such town for public use as the site of such
  drinking water wells and necessary appurtenances for the municipal
  water supply for the hamlet of Raquette Lake. In exchange therefor, the
  town of Long Lake shall convey to the state at least twelve acres of land
  located in Hamilton county for incorporation into the forest preserve
  that the legislature shall determine is at least equal in value to the land
  to be conveyed by the state. The Raquette Lake surface reservoir shall
  be abandoned as a drinking water supply source.</P>

by the state, but such work shall not be undertaken until after the
boundaries and high flow lines thereof shall have been accurately
surveyed and fixed, and after public notice, hearing and determination
that such lands are required for such public use. The expense of any
such improvements shall be apportioned on the public and private
property and municipalities benefited to the extent of the benefits
received. Any such reservoir shall always be operated by the state and
the legislature shall provide for a charge upon the property and
municipalities benefited for a reasonable return to the state upon the
value of the rights and property of the state used and the services of the
state rendered, which shall be fixed for terms of not exceeding ten years

and any interest therein, outside the forest preserve counties, and the
dedication of properties so acquired or now owned, which because of
their natural beauty, wilderness character, or geological, ecological or
historical significance, shall be preserved and administered for the use

from authorizing the granting of revocable permits or leases for periods
of time as authorized by the legislature for the occupancy or use of such
lands or structures. (Formerly §8 of Art. 7. Renumbered and amended

for the purposes specified herein may be made upon such terms and
conditions as the legislature may determine with or without compensation to the state. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the legislature
from providing annual appropriations for the state's share, if any, of the
cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the barge canal, the
divisions thereof, terminals and facilities in the event of the transfer of
the barge canal in whole to the federal government whether by lease or

<P><STRONG>[Article VII to apply to state debts under this article, with certain
exceptions; amortization of state debts; capital and periodic
subsidies]</STRONG></P>

<P>§3.	The provisions of article VII, not inconsistent with this article,
relating to debts of the state shall apply to all debts contracted by the
state for the purpose of providing moneys out of which to make loans
pursuant to this article, except (a) that any law or laws authorizing the
contracting of such debt, not exceeding in the aggregate three hundred
million dollars, shall take effect without submission to the people, and
the contracting of a greater amount of debt may not be authorized prior
to January first, nineteen hundred forty-two; (b) that any such debt and
each portion thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be paid in
equal annual installments, the first of which shall be payable not more
than three years, and the last of which shall be payable not more than
fifty years, after such debt or portion thereof shall have been contracted;
and (c) that any law authorizing the contracting of such debt may be
submitted to the people at a general election, whether or not any other
law or bill shall be submitted to be voted for or against at such election.</P>

<P>	Debts contracted by the state for the purpose of providing money out
of which to make loans to or in aid of corporations regulated by law as
to rents, profits, dividends and disposition of their property or franchises and engaged in providing housing facilities pursuant to this
article may be paid in such manner that the total annual charges required
for the payment of principal and interest are approximately equal and
constant for the entire period in which any of the bonds issued therefor
are outstanding. </P>

<P>	Any law authorizing the making of contracts for capital or periodic
subsidies to be paid with moneys currently appropriated from the
general fund of the state shall take effect without submission to the
people, and the amount to be paid under such contracts shall not be
included in ascertaining the amount of indebtedness which may be
contracted by the state under this article; provided, however, (a) that
such periodic subsidies shall not be paid for a period longer than the life
of the projects assisted thereby, but in any event for not more than sixty
years; (b) that no contracts for periodic subsidies shall be entered into
in any one year requiring payments aggregating more than one million
dollars in any one year; and (c) that there shall not be outstanding at any

<P><STRONG>[Powers of cities, towns and villages to contract indebtedness in aid
of low rent housing and slum clearance projects; restrictions
thereon]</STRONG></P>

<P>§4.	To effectuate any of the purposes of this article, the legislature may
authorize any city, town or village to contract indebtedness to an
amount which shall not exceed two per centum of the average assessed
valuation of the real estate of such city, town or village subject to
taxation, as determined by the last completed assessment roll and the
four preceding assessment rolls of such city, town or village, for city,
town or village taxes prior to the contracting of such indebtedness. In
ascertaining the power of a city, or village having a population of five
thousand or more as determined by the last federal census, to contract
indebtedness pursuant to this article there may be excluded any such
indebtedness if the project or projects aided by guarantees representing
such indebtedness or by loans for which such indebtedness was
contracted shall have yielded during the preceding year net revenue to
be determined annually by deducting from the gross revenues, including
periodic subsidies therefor, received from such project or projects, all
costs of operation, maintenance, repairs and replacements, and the
interest on such indebtedness and the amounts required in such year for
the payment of such indebtedness; provided that in the case of guarantees such interest and such amounts shall have been paid, and in the
case of loans an amount equal to such interest and such amounts shall
have been paid to such city or village. The legislature shall prescribe the
method by which the amount of any such indebtedness to be excluded
shall be determined, and no such indebtedness shall be excluded except
in accordance with such determination. The legislature may confer
appropriate jurisdiction on the appellate division of the supreme court
in the judicial departments in which such cities or villages are located
for the purpose of determining the amount of any such indebtedness to
be so excluded. </P>

<P>	The liability of a city, town or village on account of any contract for
capital or periodic subsidies to be paid subsequent to the then current
year shall, for the purpose of ascertaining the power of such city, town
or village to contract indebtedness, be deemed indebtedness in the
amount of the commuted value of the total of such capital or periodic
subsidies remaining unpaid, calculated on the basis of an annual interest
rate of four per centum. Such periodic subsidies shall not be contracted
for a period longer than the life of the projects assisted thereby, and in
no event for more than sixty years. Indebtedness contracted pursuant to
this article shall be excluded in ascertaining the power of a city or such
village otherwise to create indebtedness under any other section of this
constitution. Notwithstanding the foregoing the legislature shall not
authorize any city or village having a population of five thousand or
more to contract indebtedness hereunder in excess of the limitations
prescribed by any other article of this constitution unless at the same
time it shall by law require such city or village to levy annually a tax or
taxes other than an ad valorem tax on real estate to an extent sufficient
to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on any such
indebtedness. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed to
prevent such city or village from pledging its faith and credit for the
payment of such principal and interest nor shall any such law prevent
recourse to an ad valorem tax on real estate to the extent that revenue
derived from such other tax or taxes in any year, together with revenues
from the project or projects aided by the proceeds of such indebtedness,
shall become insufficient to provide fully for payment of such principal
and interest in that year. (Amended by vote of the people November 8,
1949.)</P>

<P><STRONG>[Liability for certain loans made by the state to certain public
corporations]</STRONG></P>

<P>§5.	Any city, town or village shall be liable for the repayment of any
loans and interest thereon made by the state to any public corporation,
acting as an instrumentality of such city, town or village. Such liability
of a city, town or village shall be excluded in ascertaining the power of
such city, town or village to become indebted pursuant to the provisions
of this article, except that in the event of a default in payment under the
terms of any such loan, the unpaid balance thereof shall be included in
ascertaining the power of such city, town or village to become so
indebted. No subsidy, in addition to any capital or periodic subsidy
originally contracted for in aid of any project or projects authorized
under this article, shall be paid by the state to a city, town, village or
public corporation, acting as an instrumentality thereof, for the purpose
of enabling such city, town, village or corporation to remedy an actual
default or avoid an impending default in the payment of principal or
interest on a loan which has been theretofore made by the state to such
city, town, village or corporation pursuant to this article. (Amended by
vote of the people November 5, 1957.)</P>

<P><STRONG>[Loans and subsidies; restrictions on and preference in occupancy
of projects]</STRONG></P>

<P>§6.	No loan, or subsidy shall be made by the state to aid any project
unless such project is in conformity with a plan or undertaking for the
clearance, replanning and reconstruction or rehabilitation of a substandard and unsanitary area or areas and for recreational and other facilities
incidental or appurtenant thereto. The legislature may provide additional
conditions to the making of such loans or subsidies consistent with the
purposes of this article. The occupancy of any such project shall be
restricted to persons of low income as defined by law and preference
shall be given to persons who live or shall have lived in such area or
areas.</P>

<P><STRONG>[Liability arising from guarantees to be deemed indebtedness;
method of computing]</STRONG></P>

<P>§7.	The liability arising from any guarantee of the principal of and
interest on indebtedness contracted by a public corporation shall be
deemed indebtedness in the amount of the face value of the principal
thereof remaining unpaid. The liability arising from any guarantee of
only the interest on indebtedness contracted by a public corporation
shall be deemed indebtedness in the amount of the commuted value of
the total interest guaranteed and remaining unpaid, calculated on the
basis of an annual interest rate of four per centum.</P>

<P><STRONG>[Excess condemnation]</STRONG></P>

<P>§8.	Any agency of the state, or any city, town, village, or public
corporation, which is empowered by law to take private property by
eminent domain for any of the public purposes specified in section one
of this article, may be empowered by the legislature to take property
necessary for any such purpose but in excess of that required for public
use after such purpose shall have been accomplished; and to improve
and utilize such excess, wholly or partly for any other public purpose,
or to lease or sell such excess with restrictions to preserve and protect
such improvement or improvements.</P>

<P><STRONG>[Acquisition of property for purposes of article]</STRONG></P>

<P>§9.	Subject to any limitation imposed by the legislature, the state, or
any city, town, village or public corporation, may acquire by purchase,
gift, eminent domain or otherwise, such property as it may deem
ultimately necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this article,
or any of them, although temporarily not required for such purposes.</P>
<P><STRONG>[Power of legislature; construction of article]</STRONG></P>
<P>§10.	The legislature is empowered to make all laws which it shall deem
necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.
This article shall be construed as extending powers which otherwise
might be limited by other articles of this constitution and shall not be
construed as imposing additional limitations; but nothing in this article
contained shall be deemed to authorize or empower the state, or any
city, town, village or public corporation to engage in any private
business or enterprise other than the building and operation of low rent
dwelling houses for persons of low income as defined by law, or the
loaning of money to owners of existing multiple dwellings as herein
provided.</P>

senate and assembly as to the effect of such amendment or amendments
upon other provisions of the constitution. Upon receiving such opinion,
if the amendment or amendments as proposed or as amended shall be

it shall be the duty of the legislature to submit each proposed amendment or amendments to the people for approval in such manner and at
such times as the legislature shall prescribe; and if the people shall
approve and ratify such amendment or amendments by a majority of the
electors voting thereon, such amendment or amendments shall become

majority of the electors voting thereon shall decide in favor of a
convention for such purpose, the electors of every senate district of the
state, as then organized, shall elect three delegates at the next ensuing
general election, and the electors of the state voting at the same election
shall elect fifteen delegates-at-large. The delegates so elected shall
convene at the capitol on the first Tuesday of April next ensuing after
their election, and shall continue their session until the business of such
convention shall have been completed. Every delegate shall receive for
his or her services the same compensation as shall then be annually
payable to the members of  the assembly and be reimbursed for actual
traveling expenses, while the convention is in session, to the extent that
a member of the assembly would then be entitled thereto in the case of
a session of the legislature. A majority of the convention shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of business, and no amendment to the
constitution shall be submitted for approval to the electors as  hereinafter provided, unless by the assent of a majority of all the delegates
elected to the convention, the ayes and noes being entered on the
journal to be kept. The convention shall have the power to appoint such
officers, employees and assistants as it may deem necessary, and fix
their compensation and to provide for the printing of its documents,
journal, proceedings and other expenses of said convention. The
convention shall determine the rules of its own proceedings, choose its
own officers, and be the judge of the  election, returns and qualifications
of its members. In case of a  vacancy, by death, resignation or other
cause, of any district  delegate elected to the convention, such vacancy
shall be filled by a vote of the remaining delegates representing the
district in which such vacancy occurs. If such vacancy occurs in the
office of a delegate-at-large, such vacancy shall be filled by a vote of the 
remaining delegates-at-large. Any proposed constitution or constitutional amendment which shall have been adopted by such convention,
shall be submitted to a vote of the electors of the state at the time and in
the manner provided by such convention, at an election which shall be
held not less than six weeks after the adjournment of such convention.
